## Overview

RIXL SDK automatically tracks content views when analytics is enabled. This guide covers configuration options and best practices for analytics integration.

## Basic Setup

Analytics are enabled by default on all components:

```tsx
<Video id="video-id" />
<Image id="image-id" />
```

To explicitly control analytics:

```tsx
<Video id="video-id" analytics={true} />
<Video id="video-id" analytics={false} />
```

## Page Context

Specify where content is being viewed to segment your analytics data:

```tsx
// Video in a scrolling feed
<Video id="video-id" analyticsPage="feed" />

// Video on a user profile
<Video id="video-id" analyticsPage="profile" />

// Standalone video page (default)
<Video id="video-id" analyticsPage="standalone" />
```

<Callout type="info">
  Setting the correct page context helps you understand where your content performs best and how users discover it.
</Callout>

## Engagement Features

### Heatmap

Display viewer engagement patterns on the progress bar. 
```tsx
<Video id="video-id" heatmap={true} />
```

### Resume Progress

Remember where users stopped watching and resume from that point:

```tsx
<Video id="video-id" resumeProgress={true} />
```

Progress is stored locally in the browser per video ID.

## What Gets Tracked

When analytics is enabled, the SDK automatically tracks:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| View Start | When content begins playing/displaying |
| Watch Duration | How long the user watched |
| View End | When playback completes or user navigates away |
| Segments | Which portions of the video were watched |

## Best Practices

1. **Always set analyticsPage** - Helps segment data by content location
2. **Enable resumeProgress for long content** - Improves user experience for videos over 5 minutes
3. **Use heatmap on popular content** - Shows viewers what others found interesting
4. **Test with analytics disabled** - Use `analytics={false}` in development if needed
