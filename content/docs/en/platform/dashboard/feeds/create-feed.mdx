## Feed Creation Workflow

<Callout type="info">
  Before creating feeds, make sure you have
  [created a project](/platform/dashboard/projects/create-project).
  Feeds are always linked to projects.
</Callout>


<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Access Feed Creation**
    Navigate to the [**Feeds** section](https://api.rixl.com/feeds) from your project dashboard and click **Create
    Feed**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Select Feed Type**
    Choose from available feed types (Video, Image, Mixed, Dynamic) depending on your content strategy.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Configure Feed Settings**
    <Tabs items={['Basic Settings', 'Visibility Options']}>
      <Tab value="Basic Settings">
        - **Feed Name**: Give your feed a clear identifier
        - **Description**: Provide context or purpose
        - **Project Association**: Select the project the feed belongs to
        - **Feed Type**: Choose or confirm the type of feed
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="Visibility Options">
        - **Public**: Available to anyone with the link
        - **Unlisted**: Hidden but accessible via direct URL
        - **Private**: Restricted to project members only
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Define Rules & Organization**
    - Filtering (tags, categories, metadata)
    - Sorting (date, popularity, manual order)
    - Content moderation or approval workflows
    - Dynamic inclusion rules (e.g., auto-add new uploads by tag)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Finalize & Deploy**
    Review your configuration, then click **Create**.
    Once created, the dashboard will generate **API endpoints** and **embed codes** for distribution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Feeds are always linked to a project. Make sure your project is set up before creating feeds.

## Content Management During Creation

**Content Addition Methods:**
- **Manual Addition**: Pick individual items from the media library
- **Bulk Operations**: Use filters to select multiple items at once
- **Dynamic Rules**: Automate inclusion based on metadata or upload behavior

## Next Steps After Creation

Once your feed is created, you can:
- Configure **display settings** and **permissions**
- Generate **embed codes** for websites and apps
- Access feeds programmatically via the API
- Share feeds with team members for collaboration

## API Method (Coming Soon)

Currently, feeds can only be created via the dashboard.  
API-based creation is planned for future versions to support automation workflows.
