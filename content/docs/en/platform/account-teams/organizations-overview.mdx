    Set up a new organization for your team or company.

    Invite members and manage their access to your organization.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Understanding Roles

### Organization-Level Roles

  <Card title="Owner">
    Full control of everything. Manages billing, adds/removes anyone, and controls all projects.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Admin">
    Creates and manages projects. Invites team members and configures settings.
  </Card>

## Best Practices

### Organization Management
- Set clear naming conventions for projects
- Establish content creation and approval workflows
- Monitor usage and costs regularly

  Start with a simple structure and add complexity as your team grows. You can always adjust roles and permissions
  later.
