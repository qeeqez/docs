Keep your RIXL account secure with multifactor authentication, connected accounts for SSO, and session monitoring.
These settings help you control who can access your account and how.

Link trusted third-party services for single sign-on (SSO) access.

**Currently Supported:**
- **Google:** Sign in with your Google account
- **Apple:** Log-in securely with your Apple ID
- **Telegram:** Connect for additional security features

### Managing Connected Accounts

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **To Connect an Account:**
    - Click **Connect** next to the desired service
    - Follow the authorization prompts from the provider
    - Confirm the connection in your RIXL security settings
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **To Disconnect an Account:**
    - Click **Disconnect** next to the connected service
    - Confirm the action when prompted
    - Ensure you have an alternative login method configured
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn" title="Before Disconnecting">
  If you use a connected account as your only sign-in method, create a password for your RIXL account **before**
  disconnecting it to avoid being locked out.
</Callout>

## Two-Factor Authentication

Add an extra layer of security with authenticator app-based 2FA.

### Setting Up 2FA

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Download an Authenticator App**
    - Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password
    - Available on iOS and Android
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Enable 2FA in RIXL**
    - Go to [Security Settings](/platform/account-teams/security)
    - Click **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**
    - Scan the QR code with your authenticator app
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Verify Setup**
    - Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app
    - Save your backup codes in a secure location
    - Test login with 2FA enabled
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Recovery Codes

When enabling 2FA, you'll receive backup recovery codes:

- **Store securely**: Keep these in a password manager or secure location
- **Use once**: Each code can only be used one time
- **Generate new codes**: Generate new codes if you've used several

  Recovery codes allow you to access your account if you lose your authenticator app.
