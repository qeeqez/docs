## Best Practices

### Security
- **Enable two-factor authentication** for all accounts, especially if you're an organization owner or admin
- **Review active sessions** regularly and revoke access from unfamiliar devices
- **Use strong, unique passwords** and consider a password manager

### Team Management
- **Assign appropriate roles** - Give team members the minimum permissions they need to do their work
- **Regular access reviews** - Periodically check who has access to your organizations and projects
- **Clear naming conventions** - Use descriptive organization and project names that make sense to your team
