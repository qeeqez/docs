## How Video Processing Works

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Analysis & Planning**

    We analyze your video to determine the best quality settings and formats for your content.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Multi-Quality Encoding**

    Your video is processed into multiple resolutions and quality levels at the same time for faster results.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Streaming Package Creation**

    We create streaming formats (HLS/DASH) that automatically adjust quality based on viewer's internet speed.
