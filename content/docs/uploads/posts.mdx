## Overview

Feeds are the core of social experiences on **Rixl**. A Post is the fundamental unit within a Feed and can be either
an image or a video. The upload process for a Post is a powerful combination of the previous flows, as it handles
the media upload and simultaneously creates the post-object ready for your social timeline or content carousel.

<Callout type="info">
    The post upload process combines media upload with post creation, handling both video content
    with automatically generated poster images, or standalone image posts.

## Post-Upload Process

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Initialize a Post Upload

        To create a new post, you start by initializing the upload using the `/feeds/{feedId}/upload/init` endpoint.
        This single request can trigger the creation of both a video and its poster image, or just an image post.
        You must specify the `feedId` of the Feed you want to publish to.

        #### Required Parameters

        **`content_type`**: Must be either `"image"` or `"video"`.

        **`file_name`**: The name of your primary media file (e.g., `my-video.mp4`).

        **`format`**: The file format of the primary media (e.g., `mp4`, `jpg`).

        **`creator_id`**: A unique identifier for the user creating the post within your system.

        **`description`**: The caption or text for the post.

        #### Optional Parameters

        **`video_quality`**: If `content_type` is `"video"`, you can set the quality (`basic`, `shorts`, `pro`).

        **`image_format`**: If `content_type` is `"video"`, this sets the format for the automatically generated poster image.

        <Tabs items={['Video Post', 'Image Post']}>
            <Tab value="Video Post">
                ```bash
                curl -X POST "https://api.rixl.com/feeds/FD4y3QB38S/upload/init" \
                -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE" \
                -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                -d '{
                        "content_type": "video",
                        "file_name": "my-awesome-clip.mp4",

                        "creator_id": "CR8y3QB38S",
                        "description": "Beautiful sunset from my balcony"

                }
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Upload Your Media Files

        Just like before, you now use the provided pre-signed URLs to upload your files directly to our storage.
        You need to upload both the main content (video) and the poster image.

        <Tabs items={['Video Upload', 'Poster Upload']}>
            <Tab value="Video Upload">
                ```bash
                curl -X PUT "{content_presigned_url}" \
                -T "/path/to/your/local/file/my-awesome-clip.mp4" \
                -H "Content-Type: video/mp4"
                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="Poster Upload">
                ```bash
                curl -X PUT "{poster_presigned_url}" \
                -T "/path/to/your/local/thumbnail/poster-image.jpg" \
                -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg"
                ```

                <Callout type="tip">
                    You can upload a custom poster image. If you don't, Rixl will automatically generate one from the video.
                </Callout>
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Mark the Post Upload as Complete

        Once both files are uploaded, you finalize the process using `/feeds/{feedId}/upload/complete`.
        This tells Rixl to process the media, create the relationships between the post, the video, and the image,
        and publish it to the specified feed.

        ```bash
        curl -X POST "https://api.rixl.com/feeds/FD4y3QB38S/upload/complete" \
        -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
                "post_id": "PS5IMKoFLm"
            }'
        ```

        <Callout type="success">
            A successful response will return the complete Post object with all its details, confirming your new post is live in the feed.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Your Posts

After uploading, you can retrieve and manage your posts using the API. Here are the common operations you'll need for post management.

### Retrieving Posts

**Get a Specific Post**: Use this when you need to fetch details for a particular post within a feed.

```bash
curl "https://api.rixl.com/feeds/FD4y3QB38S/PS5IMKoFLm" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE"
```

**List Posts in a Feed**: This is how you'd retrieve posts to display in your app with pagination support.

```bash
curl "https://api.rixl.com/feeds/FD4y3QB38S?limit=25&offset=0" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE"
```

**List Posts by a Creator**: To show all content from a specific user in a feed.

```bash
curl "https://api.rixl.com/feeds/FD4y3QB38S/creators/CR8y3QB38S?limit=25&offset=0" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### Post Operations

**Delete a Post**: Remove a post permanently from the feed.

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.rixl.com/feeds/FD4y3QB38S/PS5IMKoFLm" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE"
```

<Callout type="warn">
    Deleting a post will permanently remove it from the feed and cannot be undone.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

When working with posts and feeds, consider these recommendations for optimal performance and user experience.

**Always upload poster images** for video posts to ensure consistent loading experiences across your application.

**Use descriptive file names** to help with content organization and make debugging easier.

**Implement proper error handling** for failed uploads, including retry mechanisms for network issues.

**Consider file size limits** when uploading high-quality content to maintain good performance.

**Use pagination** when retrieving large numbers of posts to avoid overwhelming your users and API limits.
