## Upload Flow Overview

The upload process is consistent across all media types (images, videos, and posts) with specific parameters for each:

<Steps>
<Step>
**Request Signed URL** - Get a secure upload URL with processing configuration
</Step>
<Step>
**Upload to Cloud Storage** - Direct upload from your application to our cloud storage
</Step>
<Step>
**Monitor Processing** - Track status and receive notifications when complete
</Step>
</Steps>

## Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Signed URLs protect credentials and control access
- **Direct Upload**: Files transfer directly to cloud storage for optimal performance  
- **Flexible Processing**: Configure transcoding, optimization, and metadata during upload
- **Real-time Status**: Monitor processing progress with webhooks and API polling

    />
</Cards>

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Request Signed URL

Initialize the upload with your desired processing configuration:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.rixl.com/v1/{media_type}/upload/init" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "file_name": "my-file.mp4",
    "video_quality": "shorts",
    "image_format": "jpg"
  }'
```

### 2. Upload to Storage

Use the returned signed URL for direct upload:

```bash
curl -X PUT "{presigned_url}" \
  -T "/path/to/your/file" \
  -H "Content-Type: {content_type}"
```

### 3. Complete Processing

Notify RIXL to begin processing:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.rixl.com/v1/{media_type}/upload/complete" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"video_id": "YOUR_VIDEO_ID"}'
```
