## Overview

**Rixl's** upload flow is structured similarly to common upload processes found in React applications,
but it is distinguished by its enhanced security and flexibility through the use of signed URLs.
This approach allows for the uploading of media assets (videos, images, and feed posts) directly to
our integrated cloud storage while safeguarding security credentials.

<Callout type="info">
    The primary use case for Direct Uploads with **Rixl's** API is within client applications,
    such as mobile and web applications, as well as through interactive consoles connected
    to local or remote servers.
</Callout>

### Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Uses signed URLs to protect credentials
- **Direct Storage Upload**: Files go directly to cloud storage
- **Flexible Processing**: Supports management, generation, and conversion of metadata and assets
- **Optimized Efficiency**: Conserves storage space when original content is not required

## Prerequisites

<Callout type="warn">
    Ensure your project is set up and you have your API key ready before proceeding with uploads.
</Callout>

## Upload Process

The upload process is similar for Images, Videos, and Posts for feeds, with some specific parameters for each media type.

<Steps>

    ### Request a Signed Upload URL

    The initial step is to request a signed URL for the file you want to upload. This includes metadata like
    Rixl Asset settings and returns a signed URL for direct client app usage, plus an ID for status checking via the API.

    <Tabs items={['Image Upload', 'Video Upload']}>
        <Tab value="Image Upload">
            ```bash
            curl -X POST "https://api.rixl.com/images/upload/init" \
            -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{
            "name": "my-profile-picture.jpg",
            "format": "jpg"
        }'
            ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="Video Upload">
            ```bash
            curl -X POST "https://api.rixl.com/videos/upload/init" \
            -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{
            "file_name": "my-vacation-video.mp4",
            "image_format": "jpg",
            "video_quality": "pro"
        }'
            ```

            <Callout type="tip">
                For videos, you can specify the desired quality and the format for the video's poster image.
            </Callout>
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    ### Upload File to Storage

    Using the signed URL from the previous response, perform the upload from your client (mobile app, web browser, or server).
    Use an HTTP `PUT` request with the file data in the request body.

    <Callout type="info">
        The signed URL contains all necessary authenticationâ€”you don't need your API key for this step. This happens directly
        between your client and our storage system, which is fast and does not use your server's bandwidth.
    </Callout>

    #### Important Upload Guidelines

    - Set the exact headers provided in the response
    - Large files can be uploaded in parts
    - Resumable uploads: If interrupted, resume from where you left off using the `Range` header

    <Tabs items={['Image Upload', 'Video Upload']}>
        <Tab value="Image Upload">
            ```bash
            curl -X PUT "{presigned_url}" \
            -T "/path/to/your/local/file/my-profile-picture.jpg" \
            -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg"
            ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="Video Upload">
            ```bash
            curl -X PUT "{presigned_url}" \
            -T "/path/to/your/local/file/my-vacation-video.mp4" \
            -H "Content-Type: video/mp4"
            ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Callout type="warn">
        Replace `{presigned_url}` with the actual URL received from the `init` call. The `Content-Type` header should match your file type.
    </Callout>

    ### Mark Upload as Complete

    After successfully uploading to the pre-signed URL, notify **Rixl's** API that the upload is finished. This triggers the processing pipeline:

    - Video transcoding for different qualities
    - Image format optimization
    - Thumbnail generation
    - Proper format conversion

    <Tabs items={['Complete Video', 'Complete Image']}>
        <Tab value="Complete Video">
            ```bash
            curl -X POST "https://api.rixl.com/videos/upload/complete" \
            -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{
            "video_id": "VI9VXQxWXQ"
        }'
            ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="Complete Image">
            ```bash
            curl -X POST "https://api.rixl.com/images/upload/complete" \
            -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{
            "image_id": "PS5IMKoFLm",
            "attached_to_video": true
        }'
            ```

            <Callout type="tip">
                For images, you can flag if the image is meant to be a poster for a video using the `attached_to_video` parameter.
            </Callout>
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>

</Steps>

## Summary

Rixl supports secure, flexible direct uploads using signed URLs. With this approach, your clients (web, mobile, or server-side tools) upload
media directly to Rixl-managed storage without exposing your long-lived credentials.
