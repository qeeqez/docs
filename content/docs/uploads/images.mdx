Rixl automatically processes uploaded images through an optimization pipeline that reduces file sizes while preserving visual quality.

[//]: # (// TODO: Add a screenshot of the image upload interface.)

### Processing Overview

Every uploaded image undergoes automatic optimization:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Format Conversion** - Raster images converted to AVIF, SVGs preserved
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Quality Optimization** - Intelligent compression with maintained visual fidelity
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Thumbhash Generation** - Ultra-compact placeholders for instant loading
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Metadata Extraction** - Dimensions, EXIF data, and format information preserved
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **CDN Deployment** - Immediate global availability
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Supported Formats

**Raster Images (converted to AVIF):**
- HEIC/HEIF, JPEG/JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF, BMP
- TIFF/TIF, JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, JPEG XL
- WEBP2, HDR, JFIF, AVIF

**Vector Images (preserved as-is):**
- SVG - Scalable vector graphics with full interactivity

<Callout type="info" title="AVIF Optimization">
  AVIF at 50% quality produces visually identical results to JPEG at 85% while being 50-90% smaller in file size.
</Callout>

### AVIF Settings

- **Quality:** 50% for optimal balance between size and quality
- **Color Depth:** 8-bit for universal browser compatibility
- **EXIF Data:** Camera metadata and color profiles preserved
- **Auto-Rotation:** Correct orientation based on EXIF data

### Thumbhash Technology

Every processed image generates a ~25-byte thumbhash for instant placeholder rendering:

- **Zero network requests** - Embedded in your application data
- **Instant rendering** - Immediate visual feedback
- **Color-accurate** - Preserves dominant colors and contrast
- **Smooth transitions** - Natural blur-to-sharp loading effect

**Implementation Example:**

## Performance Impact

**File Size Reductions:**
- **Photography:** 70-90% smaller than JPEG
- **Screenshots:** 60-80% reduction from PNG
- **Graphics with text:** 50-70% improvement
- **Web graphics:** 40-60% smaller than WebP

**Loading Performance:**
- Instant placeholders eliminate loading delays
- Reduced bandwidth usage, especially on mobile
- Improved Core Web Vitals scores
- Better perceived performance

## Browser Support

<Callout type="info">
    **AVIF supported by ~95% of modern browsers**

## Processing Pipeline Details

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Upload and Check
        Images are added to the processing queue and checked for valid formats and security issues.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### File Type Detection
        The system identifies SVG files to keep unchanged and sends other images for conversion.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Image Optimization
        Images are converted to AVIF format for smaller file sizes while keeping quality high.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Create Placeholders
        Small preview images are generated for fast loading while the full image loads.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Distribute Globally
        Optimized images are deployed to servers worldwide for fast delivery to users.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

**When Uploading:**
- Upload your highest quality images, it'd optimize automatically
- Use clear, descriptive file names to stay organized
- Add alt text descriptions for screen readers

**When Loading Images:**
- Use our placeholder images for instant feedback while photos load
- Load images progressively for a better user experience
- Wait for processing to complete on large files
- Save processed image URLs to reduce API calls

## Security Features

**Upload Protection:**
- Checks file types to ensure they're actually images
- Enforces file size limits at every step

**Access Control:**
- Images are isolated within each project
- API keys required for all access
