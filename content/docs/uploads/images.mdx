<Callout type="info">
    After completing any [upload](https://api.rixl.com/images) (individual images, videos, or feed posts), **Rixl** automatically processes your images
    through an optimization pipeline that dramatically reduces file sizes while preserving visual quality.
</Callout>

## Processing Overview

Every uploaded image undergoes automatic optimization:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **Format Conversion** - Raster images converted to AVIF, SVGs preserved
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Quality Optimization** - Intelligent compression with maintained visual fidelity
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Thumbhash Generation** - Ultra-compact placeholders for instant loading
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Metadata Extraction** - Dimensions, EXIF data, and format information preserved
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **CDN Deployment** - Immediate global availability with cache invalidation
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Formats

<Tabs items={['Raster Images', 'Vector Images']}>
    <Tab value="Raster Images">

        - **TIFF/TIF** - High-quality uncompressed images
        - **JPEG 2000 (JP2/JPX/J2K)** - Advanced JPEG successor
        - **JPEG XR (JXR/WDP/HDP)** - Microsoft's JPEG successor
        - **JPEG XL (JXL)** - Next-generation image format
        - **WEBP2** - Google's next-gen WebP format
        - **HDR** - Radiance HDR image format
        - **JFIF** - JPEG File Interchange Format
        - **AVIF** - AV1 image file format
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Vector Images">
        **Preserved as-is:**
        - **SVG** - Scalable vector graphics with full interactivity and animations
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

</Cards>

<Callout type="tip">
    AVIF at 50% quality produces visually identical results to JPEG at 85% while being 50-90% smaller in file size.
</Callout>

## Thumbhash Technology

Every processed image generates a ~25-byte thumbhash for instant placeholder rendering:

**Benefits:**
- **Zero network requests** - Embedded in your application data
- **Instant rendering** - Immediate visual feedback
- **Color-accurate** - Preserves dominant colors and contrast
- **Smooth transitions** - Natural blur-to-sharp loading effect

**Implementation Example:**

```md
We can have an implementation example here
```

## Performance Impact

**File Size Reductions:**
- **Photography:** 70-90% smaller than JPEG
- **Screenshots:** 60-80% reduction from PNG
- **Graphics with text:** 50-70% improvement
- **Web graphics:** 40-60% smaller than WebP

**Loading Performance:**
- Instant placeholders eliminate loading delays
- Reduced bandwidth usage, especially on mobile
- Improved Core Web Vitals scores
- Better perceived performance

## Browser Support

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Queue and Validation
        Images queued after upload completion with format and security validation
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Format Detection
        System routes SVG files for preservation, raster images for AVIF conversion
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Optimization Processing
        AVIF encoding with quality optimization and EXIF preservation
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Thumbhash Generation
        Ultra-compact placeholder generation for instant loading
    </Step>

    <Step>

## Implementation Best Practices

**Upload Strategy:**
- Upload the highest quality originalsâ€”processing optimizes automatically
- Use descriptive filenames for a better organization
- Include alt text for accessibility

**Loading Implementation:**
- Always use thumb hash placeholders for instant feedback
- Implement progressive loading patterns
- Monitor processing completion for large files
- Cache processed URLs to minimize API calls

## Security Features

**Upload Security:**
- MIME type and content verification
- File size limits are enforced at all stages

**Access Control:**
- Project-level image isolation
- API key authentication required
- Time-limited signed URLs for sensitive content
