Organizations help you group projects together and manage your team in one place. Create organizations for your company, team, or personal projects.

## Getting Started

<div className="grid gap-6 sm:grid-cols-2">
    <InteractiveCard
        title="Create an Organization"
        description="Set up a new organization for your team or company."
        href="/docs/account/organizations/create-organization"
        icon="Building"
    />
    <InteractiveCard
        title="Team Management"
        description="Invite members and manage their access to your organization."
        href="/docs/account/organizations/team-management"
        icon="Users"
    />
</div>

## Understanding Roles

### Organization-Level Roles

<div className="grid gap-6 sm:grid-cols-3 mt-6">
    <InfoCard title="Owner" description="Full control of everything. Manages billing, adds/removes anyone, and controls all projects." />

    <InfoCard title="Admin" description="Creates and manages projects. Invites team members and configures settings." />

    <InfoCard title="Member" description="Works on assigned projects only. Can create content but can't manage the organization." />
</div>

## Quick Actions

### Your Memberships

Check all organizations you belong to and your role in each:
- Navigate to **Account Settings â†’ Memberships**
- View your role and permissions in each organization
- Manage organization invitations

## Best Practices

### Security
- Use unique, descriptive organization names
- Regularly review team member access
- Enable two-factor authentication requirements
- Follow the principle of least privilege for role assignments

### Organization Management
- Set clear naming conventions for projects
- Establish content creation and approval workflows
- Monitor usage and costs regularly
- Document your organization's processes

<Callout type="tip">
    Start with a simple structure and add complexity as your team grows. You can always adjust roles and permissions later.
