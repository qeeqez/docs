## Security Best Practices

### Access Management
- Review team member access quarterly
- Remove inactive or departed team members
- Audit role assignments for appropriateness
- Use specific usernames for invitations
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Managing Project Access

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Navigate to the specific project settings
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Go to **Project Settings → Team**
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Add team members to the project with appropriate roles
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
    Organization-level permissions can override project-level permissions. An organization Admin can access any project, regardless of project-specific role assignments.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Invitation Issues
- **Username isn't found:** Verify exact spelling and confirm the user has RIXL account
- **Pending invitations:** Check notifications, resend if necessary
- **Role changes not taking effect:** Allow time to propagate, try logging out/in

### Access Problems
- **Member can't access projects:** Verify organization role and project permissions
- **Admin limitations:** Some features are Owner-only (billing, organization deletion)
