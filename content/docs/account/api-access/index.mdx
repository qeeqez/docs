Control how external applications and services access your RIXL projects through secure API authentication.

## Quick Start

To start using the RIXL API, you need an API key for secure authentication. API keys are project-specific and control which resources can be accessed.

### **Basic workflow**
<Steps>

  <Step>

  Create an API key for your project
  
  </Step>

  <Step>

  Configure security settings (optional)
  
  </Step>

  <Step>

  Use the key in your applications

  </Step>
  <Step>
 
  Monitor usage and performance
 
  </Step>

</Steps>

## API Access Management

**Configurable permissions**: Control exactly which operations each key can perform.

**Usage monitoring**: Track API usage, performance metrics, and identify potential issues.

## Getting Started

<Callout type="info">
Most users start with creating their first API key and testing it with basic API calls.
</Callout>

**For new users**: Start with the [API Keys overview](/docs/account/api-access/keys) to create your first key.

**For developers**: Review the [Authentication Guide](/docs/account/api-access/authentication) for implementation details.

[//]: # (**For security teams**: Check the [security settings]&#40;/docs/account/api-access/keys/security&#41; for advanced security controls.)

## Common Use Cases

**Third-party integrations**: Connect RIXL with other platforms and services

**Web applications**: Upload and manage media content programmatically

**Mobile apps**: Secure backend integration for media processing

**Analytics services**: Read-only access for usage analysis and reporting

**Content management**: Automated content workflows and bulk operations
