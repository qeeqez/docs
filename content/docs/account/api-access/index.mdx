Ready to integrate RIXL into your applications? API keys are your gateway to programmatic access, letting you upload, process, and deliver media through our powerful REST API.

## Getting Your First API Key

<Steps>
  <Step>
  **Create Project API Key**
  
  Each project gets its own API keys for security isolation. Start by creating a key for your target project.
  </Step>

  <Step>
  **Configure Permissions** *(Optional)*
  
  Set specific permissions to control exactly what each key can access—uploads, reads, analytics, or everything.
  </Step>

  <Step>
  **Integrate & Test**
  
  Use your key in applications and test with our comprehensive API documentation and examples.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
  **Monitor & Scale**
  
  Track usage, monitor performance, and create additional keys as your integration grows.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API Key Benefits

**Project Isolation**: Each API key is scoped to a specific project, keeping your media and team access completely separate.

**Granular Permissions**: Control whether keys can upload, read, manage feeds, or access analytics—perfect for different use cases.

**Usage Analytics**: Monitor API calls, track performance, and identify optimization opportunities in real-time.

**Enterprise Security**: Rotate keys easily, set expiration dates, and revoke access instantly when needed.

## Perfect For Every Use Case

**Web Applications**: Direct media uploads, real-time processing status, and CDN delivery integration.

**Mobile Apps**: Secure backend integration for user-generated content and media optimization.

**Content Workflows**: Automated bulk processing, scheduled uploads, and content management systems.

**Analytics & Reporting**: Read-only access for usage analysis, performance monitoring, and business intelligence.

**Third-Party Integrations**: Connect RIXL with your existing tools, platforms, and automated workflows.
