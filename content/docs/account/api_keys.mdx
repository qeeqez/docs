This section allows you to view and manage the API keys that grant external applications access to your Rixl projects.

### Viewing Your API Keys

API keys are generated and managed at the project level. To view the keys associated with your account:

1. Navigate to the **Projects** section from your main dashboard.
2. Select the specific project you want to manage.
3. Click on the **Settings** or **API Keys** tab within the project view.

Here, you will see a list of all active API keys for that project, including:

- **Key Name/Description:** A label to help you identify the key's purpose (e.g., "Mobile App Production", "Staging Server").
- **Created Date:** When the key was generated.
- **Last Used:** The last time the key was used to make an API request, helping you identify inactive keys.
- **Permissions:** The scope of access granted (e.g., read-only, upload, full access).

<Callout type="info">
    API key management is handled at the project level. You must be an owner or administrator of a project to view or manage its API keys.

### Creating a New API Key

When you need to integrate a new application:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Generate a New Key

        From your project's API Keys page, click the **"Generate New Key"** button.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Configure Key Settings

        You will be prompted to provide:
        - A descriptive name for the key.
        - An optional expiration date for enhanced security.
        - Specific permissions (e.g., allow uploads, allow deletes, read-only access).
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Securely Store the Key

        Once generated, the **secret key value will be displayed only once**. Copy it immediately and store it in a secure location,
        such as a password manager or your application's secure configuration. You will not be able to retrieve the full key again for security reasons.
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn">
    **Treat your API keys like passwords.** Anyone with access to a key can perform actions on your project and potentially incur costs.
    Never commit API keys to public code repositories.
</Callout>

### Managing Key Security

- **Rotate Keys Regularly:** For best security practices, periodically delete old keys and generate new ones,
especially if a key may have been compromised.
- **Review Key Usage:** Regularly check the "Last Used" timestamp. If you see activity on a key you no
longer use, it may indicate unauthorized access, and you should revoke it immediately.
- **Set Expirations:** For temporary integrations, always set an expiration date on the API key so access is automatically revoked.

### Revoking API Keys

If you need to permanently disable access for an application or suspect a key has been leaked:

1. Find the key in your project's API Keys list.
2. Click the **Revoke** or **Delete** button next to it.
3. Confirm the action.

This action is immediate and irreversible. Any application using that key will no longer be able to communicate with the Rixl API,
so ensure you update your application configurations with a new key first if necessary.

## Account Security Actions

This section covers critical actions to maintain the security of your account.

### Password Reset

If you forget your password, you can initiate a reset process:

1. On the login page, click the **"Forgot Password?"** link.
2. Enter the email address associated with your Rixl account.
3. Check your inbox for a password reset email from Rixl and click the link provided.
4. Follow the instructions to create a new, strong password.

<Callout type="info">
    The link in the reset email is time-sensitive for security reasons and will expire after a few hours. If it expires, you can request a new reset link.
</Callout>

### Account Deactivation

If you need to temporarily or permanently deactivate your account, please contact our support team directly through the help
center or at `support@rixl.com`. Our team will guide you through the necessary steps, which include verifying your identity to prevent unauthorized account closure.

<Callout type="warn">
    **Account deletion is permanent and cannot be reversed.** All your projects, media assets, uploaded files, and configuration data will be irrecoverably deleted.
</Callout>

**Before Requesting Account Deletion:**

- **Export or backup** any important projects, media files, and data.
- **Cancel** any active subscriptions and resolve final billing arrangements.
- **Transfer ownership** of shared projects to other team members if they need to remain active.
- **Inform your team members** of your departure from any shared organizations.
