Keep your RIXL account secure with multi-factor authentication, connected accounts for SSO, and active session monitoring.

## Connected Accounts

Link third-party services for single sign-on (SSO) access to RIXL.

**Currently Supported:**
- **Google:** Quick and secure login with your Google account
- **Apple:** Privacy-focused authentication with Apple ID  
- **Telegram:** Connect for additional security features

### Managing Connected Accounts

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **To Connect an Account:**
        - Click **Connect** next to the desired service
        - Follow the authorization prompts from the provider
        - Confirm the connection in your RIXL security settings
    </Step>

    <Step>
        **To Disconnect an Account:**
        - Click **Disconnect** next to the connected service
        - Confirm the action when prompted
        - Ensure you have alternative login methods configured
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn" title="Before Disconnecting">
If you use a connected account as your only sign-in method, set a password for your RIXL account **before** disconnecting it to avoid being locked out.
</Callout>

## Two-Factor Authentication

Add an extra layer of security with authenticator app-based 2FA.

### Setting Up 2FA

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **Download an Authenticator App**
        - Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password
        - Available on iOS and Android
    </Step>

    <Step>
        **Enable 2FA in RIXL**
        - Navigate to Security Settings
        - Click **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**
        - Scan the QR code with your authenticator app
    </Step>

    <Step>
        **Verify Setup**
        - Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app
        - Save your backup codes in a secure location
        - Test login with 2FA enabled
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Recovery Codes

When enabling 2FA, you'll receive backup recovery codes:

- **Store securely**: Keep these in a password manager or secure location
- **Use sparingly**: Each code can only be used once
- **Generate new codes**: If you use several codes, generate fresh ones

<Callout type="info">
Recovery codes allow you to access your account if you lose your authenticator device.
