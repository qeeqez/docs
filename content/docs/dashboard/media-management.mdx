## Media Security and Permissions

### Access Control

Project access permissions control media assets. Team member roles determine access levels. API key permissions manage programmatic access. The organization applies security policies.

Set privacy for each asset. Share using permissions and choose public or private status. Manage direct access URLs. Control who can embed content.

<Callout type="warning">
Ensure regular backups of critical media assets for maximum data security.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

### Video Management

- Choose appropriate video optimization settings based on use case
- Use descriptive names and metadata for easy organization
- Monitor processing status and address errors promptly
- Regularly review storage usage and optimize as needed

### Image Management

- Upload images in high quality and use transformations for delivery
- Leverage automatic format optimization for better performance
- Use descriptive naming conventions for team collaboration
