## How to Navigate

Your dashboard has two main areas that work together seamlessly:

**Project Workspace** — This is where the magic happens. Upload media, create feeds, and manage your daily content workflows. Everything here is project-specific and organized exactly how you need it.

**Settings & Admin** — Account management, team permissions, billing, and API configuration live here. Think of it as your control center for everything that spans across projects.

**Pro Tip:** The media library is your creative hub—upload anything, and RIXL automatically optimizes it for web delivery through our global CDN. No configuration needed.
