Welcome to RIXL! This guide will have you uploading and optimizing media in just a few minutes. We've designed the onboarding to be as smooth as possible—no complex configuration required.

## What You'll Need

**Before we start:**
- A RIXL account ([create one here](https://app.rixl.com) if you haven't already)
- Some sample files to test with (any video or image will do)
- 5 minutes of your time

**By the end of this guide:**
You'll have uploaded your first media files, seen RIXL's optimization in action, and understand how to navigate the platform. Plus, you'll be ready to invite your team and start building something amazing.

## Your First RIXL Project

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Create Your Workspace**
    
    Think of projects as your organized workspaces—each one keeps your media, team, and settings neatly separated.
    
    Head to **Settings → Projects → Create New Project** and set up:
    - **Project Name**: Something you'll recognize (like "Marketing Videos" or "Product Photos")
    - **Server Location**: Pick the region closest to where most of your users are
    - **Video Quality**: Start with "Shorts" for social content or "Pro" for professional videos
    
    <Callout type="info">
      Choose your server location carefully—it affects how fast your content loads for users and can't be changed later.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Get Your API Keys** *(You can skip this for now)*
    
    If you plan to integrate RIXL into an app or website, you'll need [API keys](/docs/account/api-access/create-key). Each project gets its own set of keys for security.
    
    Don't worry about this step if you're just testing things out—you can always come back to it later.
    
    <Callout type="warning">
      API keys are like passwords for your project. Keep them secure and never share them publicly.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Upload Something Awesome**
    
    Time for the fun part! Go to the [Media section](/docs/dashboard/media) and drag in some files.
    
    **What you can upload:**
    - **Videos**: MP4, MOV, AVI, and more (up to 2GB each)
    - **Images**: JPG, PNG, HEIC, SVG, and others (up to 100MB each)
    
    RIXL will automatically optimize everything for web delivery—you'll see the magic happen in real-time.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Invite Your Team** *(Optional but recommended)*
    
    Working with others? Set up an [Organization](/docs/account/organizations/team-management) and invite your team.
    
    **Available roles:**
    - **Owner**: Can do everything (including manage billing)
    - **Admin**: Can manage projects and team members
    - **Member**: Can upload and manage content
    - **Viewer**: Can view content but not make changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  **First time with media optimization?** Don't worry! Check out our [Dashboard Overview](/docs/dashboard) to get familiar with the interface, then come back here to start uploading.
