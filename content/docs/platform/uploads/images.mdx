## How Image Processing Works

Every image you upload gets the full optimization treatment:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Smart Format Selection**

    Raster images become ultra-efficient AVIF files, while SVGs stay perfectly crisp as vectors.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Intelligent Compression**

    Advanced algorithms find the perfect balance between tiny file sizes and stunning visual quality.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Instant Placeholders**

    Generate ultra-compact thumbhash placeholders so your pages load instantly, even on slow connections.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Metadata Preservation**

    Keep all the important stuff—dimensions, camera settings, color profiles—while ditching unnecessary bloat.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Global Distribution**

    Your optimized images hit our global CDN immediately, ready for lightning-fast delivery anywhere in the world.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What We Support

**Raster Images** *(get the AVIF treatment)*
- **Common formats**: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, BMP
- **Professional formats**: HEIC/HEIF, TIFF, JPEG 2000
- **Next-gen formats**: JPEG XL, WEBP2, HDR, AVIF

**Vector Graphics** *(stay perfect as-is)*
- **SVG files**: Keep all their scalability and interactivity intact

<Callout type="info" title="The AVIF Advantage">
  Here's the magic: AVIF at 50% quality looks identical to JPEG at 85% but is 50-90% smaller. Your users get faster
  loading, you save bandwidth costs—everyone wins.
</Callout>

## Behind the Scenes

**AVIF Optimization Settings**
- **Quality Level**: 50% for the sweet spot between size and visual perfection
- **Color Depth**: 8-bit for universal browser support (no compatibility worries)
- **Smart Metadata**: Camera settings and color profiles preserved when useful
- **Auto-Rotation**: Images display correctly based on their EXIF orientation data

**Thumbhash Technology**
Your images also generate tiny ~25-byte "thumbhash" placeholders that create beautiful, instant-loading previews while the full image loads in the background.

- **Zero network requests** - Embedded in your application data
- **Instant rendering** - Immediate visual feedback
- **Color-accurate** - Preserves dominant colors and contrast
- **Smooth transitions** - Natural blur-to-sharp loading effect

## Processing Pipeline Details

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Upload and Check
    Images are added to the processing queue and checked for valid formats and security issues.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### File Type Detection
    The system identifies SVG files to keep unchanged and sends other images for conversion.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Image Optimization
    Images are converted to AVIF format for smaller file sizes while keeping quality high.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Create Placeholders
    Small preview images are generated for fast loading while the full image loads.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Distribute Globally
    Optimized images are deployed to servers worldwide for fast delivery to users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

**When Uploading:**
- Upload your highest quality images, it'd optimize automatically
- Use clear, descriptive file names to stay organized
- Add alt text descriptions for screen readers

**When Loading Images:**
- Use our placeholder images for instant feedback while photos load
- Load images progressively for a better user experience
- Wait for processing to complete on large files
- Save processed image URLs to reduce API calls

## Security Features

**Upload Protection:**
- Checks file types to ensure they're actually images
- Enforces file size limits at every step

**Access Control:**
- Images are isolated within each project
- API keys required for all access
