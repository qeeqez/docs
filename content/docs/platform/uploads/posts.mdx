description: Create social media-style posts by uploading media directly to feeds.

import { Callout } from '@/components';

Feed posts combine media uploads with social metadata to create rich content for structured feeds.
This process uploads media and creates the post simultaneously.

[//]: # (// TODO: Add a screenshot of the post creation interface.)

<Callout type="info">
    Feed posts require an existing feed. Learn about [creating feeds](/platform/dashboard/feeds/overview) if you haven't set one up yet.
</Callout>

## Post Types

**Video Posts** - Upload videos with automatic poster generation and thumbnail images for feed display.

**Image Posts** - Upload standalone images optimized for various display contexts and transformations.

### Upload Media Files

Use the provided presigned URLs to upload your files directly to storage:

<Tabs items={['Video Upload', 'Poster Upload']}>
    <Tab value="Video Upload">
        ```bash
        # Upload video file with progress indicator and error handling
        curl -# -f \
          -X PUT "{content_presigned_url}" \
          --upload-file "/path/to/your/local/file/my-awesome-clip.mp4" \
          -H "Content-Type: video/mp4" \
          -H "Accept: application/json" \
          --retry 3 \
          --retry-delay 2 \
          --max-time 300
        ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab value="Poster Upload">
        ```bash
        # Upload poster image with error handling and timeout
        curl -# -f \
          -X PUT "{poster_presigned_url}" \
          --upload-file "/path/to/your/local/thumbnail/poster-image.jpg" \
          -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" \
          -H "Accept: application/json" \
          --retry 3 \
          --retry-delay 2 \
          --max-time 60
        ```

        <Callout type="tip">
            You can upload a custom poster image. If you don't, RIXL will automatically generate one from the video.
        </Callout>
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Complete Upload

Once files are uploaded, finalize the process:

```bash
# Complete upload process with error handling
curl -f -s -S \
  -X POST "https://api.rixl.com/feeds/FD4y3QB38S/upload/complete" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  --retry 3 \
  --retry-delay 1 \
  --max-time 30 \
  --data '{
    "post_id": "PS5IMKoFLm"
  }'
```

<Callout type="success">
    A successful response will return the complete Post object with all its details, confirming your new post is live in the feed.
</Callout>

## Managing Your Posts

After uploading, you can retrieve and manage your posts using the API. Here are the common operations you'll need for post management.

### Retrieving Posts

**Get a Specific Post**: Use this when you need to fetch details for a particular post within a feed.

```bash
curl "https://api.rixl.com/feeds/FD4y3QB38S/PS5IMKoFLm" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE"
```

**List Posts in a Feed**: This is how you'd retrieve posts to display in your app with pagination support.

```bash
curl "https://api.rixl.com/feeds/FD4y3QB38S?limit=25&offset=0" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE"
```

**List Posts by a Creator**: To show all content from a specific user in a feed.

```bash
# List posts by creator with error handling
curl -f -s -S \
  "https://api.rixl.com/feeds/FD4y3QB38S/creators/CR8y3QB38S?limit=25&offset=0" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  --retry 3 \
  --retry-delay 1 \
  --max-time 30
```

### Post Operations

**Delete a Post**: Remove a post permanently from the feed.

```bash
# Delete post with error handling
curl -f -s -S \
  -X DELETE "https://api.rixl.com/feeds/FD4y3QB38S/PS5IMKoFLm" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  --retry 2 \
  --retry-delay 1 \
  --max-time 30
```

<Callout type="warn">
    Deleting a post will permanently remove it from the feed and cannot be undone.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

When working with posts and feeds, consider these recommendations for optimal performance and user experience.

**Always upload poster images** for video posts to ensure consistent loading experiences across your application.

**Use descriptive file names** to help with content organization and make debugging easier.

**Implement proper error handling** for failed uploads, including retry mechanisms for network issues.

**Consider file size limits** when uploading high-quality content to maintain good performance.
