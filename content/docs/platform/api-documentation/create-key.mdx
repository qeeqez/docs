To secure your projects, Rixl uses project-specific API keys for all API requests. This guide explains how to create, manage, and use them.

[//]: # (// TODO: Add diagram here showing the API key authentication workflow.)

## How API Keys Work

API keys are the primary method for authenticating with the Rixl API. They are scoped to a single project and grant access to its resources.

- **Project-Scoped:** Each key is tied to a specific project.
- **Secure by Default:** Keys are only displayed once upon creation.
- **Configurable:** You can set names and expiration dates for better management.

<Callout type="warn" title="Security Notice">
    API keys are shown only once when you create them. Store your keys securely and do not expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
</Callout>

## Creating an API Key

You can create an API key either from your dashboard's **Quick Actions** or from your created project settings.

[//]: # (// TODO: Add a screenshot or GIF of the API key creation interface.)

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **Access the Creation Interface:**
        - **Option 1:** Log in to your dashboard, click on **Quick Action**, then select **Create API Key**
        - **Option 2:** Navigate to your **Project Settings** in the dashboard and select the **API Keys** tab
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the **Create API Key** button.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Configure the Key:**
        - **Key Name:** Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Production App" or "Development-Test")
        - **Project:** Assign the key to a specific project
        - **Expiration:** Set an expiration date. For production, consider a year. For testing, a shorter duration like 7 or 30 days is safer
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Create and Store the Key:**
        Click **Create API Key**. The key will be displayed on your screen. Copy it immediately and store it in a secure place like a password manager or an environment variable.
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn" title="Store Your Key Immediately">
    For security reasons, your API key is only shown to you **once** upon creation. You will not be able to retrieve it again.
</Callout>

## Using Your API Key

To authenticate an API request, include the key in the `X-API-Key` header.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.rixl.com/videos" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY"
```

### Common Examples

<Tabs items={['Get Projects', 'Initialize Video Upload', 'Initialize Image Upload']}>
    <Tab value="Get Projects">
        ```bash
        curl -X GET "https://api.rixl.com/projects" \
        -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY"
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Initialize Video Upload">
        ```bash
        curl -X POST "https://api.rixl.com/videos/upload/init" \
        -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
        "file_name": "my-video.mp4",
        "video_quality": "shorts"
    }'
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Initialize Image Upload">
        ```bash
        curl -X POST "https://api.rixl.com/images/upload/init" \
        -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
        "file_name": "my-image.jpg"
    }'
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verification

Test your new API key with a simple API call to verify it's working correctly:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.rixl.com/projects" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY"
```

You should receive a response with your project information, confirming the key is working correctly.

## Next Steps

- **Set up authentication** in your application using the new API key
- **Monitor usage** to ensure the key is working as expected

## Troubleshooting

- **Key is not working immediately**: New keys are active immediately, but if you're having issues, verify you copied the complete key without extra spaces
- **Permission denied errors**: Ensure the key is associated with the correct project, and you have necessary permissions
- **API call failures**: Check that you're using the correct base URL and request format
