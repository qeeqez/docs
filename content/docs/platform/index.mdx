**RIXL** makes it easy to manage media in your applications. Whether you're building a social platform, e-commerce site, or mobile app, RIXL optimizes videos and images for smooth delivery on any device and network.

Upload your media using the [RIXL dashboard](/platform/dashboard) or connect directly with the [API](/platform/api-reference/overview). RIXL processes your files and returns optimized media that loads quickly and looks great everywhere.
