**RIXL** makes it easy to manage media in your applications with ease. Whether you're building a social platform, e-commerce site, or mobile app, RIXL automatically optimizes your videos and images for smooth delivery across every device and network condition.

You can upload your media using the [RIXL dashboard](/docs/platform/dashboard/overview) or connect directly with the [API](/docs/platform/api-reference). RIXL will handle the processing and return optimized media that loads quickly and looks great everywhere.
