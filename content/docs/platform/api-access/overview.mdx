Ready to integrate RIXL into your applications? API keys are your gateway to programmatic access,
letting you upload, process, and deliver media through our powerful REST API.

## Getting Your First API Key

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **Create Project API Key**

        Each project gets its own API keys for security isolation. Start by creating a key for your target project.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        **Configure Permissions** *(Optional)*

        Set specific permissions to control exactly what each key can access—uploads, reads, analytics, or everything.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        **Integrate & Test**

        Use your key in applications and test with our comprehensive API documentation and examples.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        **Monitor & Scale**

        Track usage, monitor performance, and create additional keys as your integration grows.
    </Step>
</Steps>
