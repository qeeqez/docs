Once a project is created, you can manage it directly from the dashboard.  
This includes switching between projects, tracking usage, monitoring team activity, and performing management actions.

## Collaboration & Team Access

Projects include built-in team collaboration:

- Invite new team members and assign roles  
- Monitor project activity and contributions  
- Adjust permissions as your team grows  
- Ensure secure access with project-scoped API keys  

For details on roles and permissions, see [Project Settings → Access & Permissions](/platform/dashboard/projects/project-settings).
