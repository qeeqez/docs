Projects in **RIXL** are workspaces that organize your media, team members, and settings. Each project is isolated, giving you a clean separation of content, permissions, and analytics.

<Callout type="info">
You need at least one project to use the main dashboard. If you don’t have one, you’ll be prompted to create it on first login.
</Callout>
