Projects organize your media content and team access in RIXL. Each project is isolated with its own media, settings, and team permissions.

- Storage region (view only after creation)

**Advanced Settings:**
- Team access and permissions
- API key management
- Processing and quality settings

#### Video Processing Tiers

| Tier       | Quality          | Resolution  | Processing Speed | Use Case              |
|------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| **Basic**  | Standard         | Up to 720p  | Standard         | Development & Testing |

| **Pro**    | Professional     | Up to 4K    | Priority         | Video-on-Demand       |

<Callout type="info">
You can upgrade your video optimization tier at any time from [project settings](/platform/dashboard/projects/project-settings).
</Callout>

<Callout type="error" title="Project Deletion">
Deleting a project permanently removes all videos, images, feeds, and settings. This action cannot be reversed.
</Callout>

## Common Use Cases

**Content Organization**: Separate projects for different brands, campaigns, or content types

**Team Collaboration**: Project-specific access control for different team members

**Development Workflows**: Separate staging and production environments

**Client Management**: Individual projects for different clients or stakeholders

## Next Steps

After creating your project:
1. **Upload Media** - Start adding [videos](/platform/dashboard/media/upload-videos) and [images](/platform/dashboard/media/upload-images)
2. **Configure Team Access** - Set up [team permissions](/platform/account/organizations/team-management)
3. **Generate API Keys** - Create [authentication tokens](/platform/account/api-access) for integrations
4. **Organize Content** - Use [feeds](/platform/dashboard/feeds) to structure your media

Your project dashboard shows:

- **Storage usage** and file counts
- **Recent uploads** and processing status
- **Team activity** and collaboration metrics
- **Quick actions** for uploading content

### Next Steps

Once you have a project set up, you can start [uploading media](/platform/dashboard/media),
[creating feeds](/platform/dashboard/feeds), or [inviting team members](/platform/account/organizations/team-management).
- **Invite new team members** with appropriate role assignments
- Role-based access controls and permissions

### API Integration Center

- View and manage all project-associated API keys
- Monitor API usage patterns and consumption
- **Create new secure API keys** for application integration
- RESTful API endpoint documentation and SDK integration examples

### Quick Upload Interface

- **Upload New Videos**: Drag-and-drop video content addition
- **Upload New Images**: Batch image upload with optimization
- Progress tracking with automatic processing pipeline integration
