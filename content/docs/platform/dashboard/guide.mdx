## What You'll Need

**Before we start:**
- A RIXL account ([create one here](https://app.rixl.com))
- Some sample media files (video or image)
- About 5 minutes

**By the end of this guide:** you'll have a project, uploaded media, seen optimization in action, and optionally created API keys and invited teammates.

## Your First RIXL Project

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Create Your Workspace**

    Projects keep your media, team, and settings separate. Go to **Settings →
    Projects → Create New Project** and fill in:

    - **Project Name**: Something you'll recognize (like "Marketing Videos" or
      "Product Photos")
    - **Description** (optional)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Pick Server Location**

    Choose the region closest to your users for best delivery performance:

    - **US East**, **US West**, **Europe**

    <Callout type="warning">
      Server location cannot be changed after creation — choose carefully.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Select Default Optimization**

    Pick a default video quality tier:

    - **Shorts** — social/mobile
    - **Standard** — general web delivery
    - **Pro** — VOD / high-fidelity
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Create & Continue**

    After creation you can immediately start
    [uploading media](/platform/dashboard/media/overview) and create
    [API keys](/platform/dashboard/api-keys) if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Upload Something (Quick)**

    In your project, go to the
    [Media section](/platform/dashboard/media/overview) and drag in some files.

    **What you can upload:**

    - **Videos**: MP4, MOV, AVI, and more (up to 2GB each)
    - **Images**: JPG, PNG, HEIC, SVG, and others (up to 100MB each)

    RIXL will automatically optimize everything for web delivery—you'll see the
    magic happen in real-time.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Get Your API Keys** *(Optional for getting started)*

    If you plan to integrate RIXL into an app or website, you'll need
    [API keys](/platform/dashboard/api-keys). Each project gets its own set of
    keys for security.

    Don't worry about this step if you're just testing things out—you can always
    come back to it later.

    <Callout type="warning">
      API keys are like passwords for your project. Keep them secure and never
      share them publicly.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Invite Your Team** *(Optional but recommended)*

    Working with others? Set up an
    [Organization](/platform/account-teams/team-management) and invite your team.

    **Available roles:**

    - **Owner**: Can do everything (including manage billing)
    - **Admin**: Can manage projects and team members
    - **Member**: Can upload and manage content
    - **Viewer**: Can view content but not make changes
  </Step>
