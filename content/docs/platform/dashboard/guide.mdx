## What You'll Need

**Before we start:**
- A RIXL account ([create one here](https://app.rixl.com))
- Some sample media files (video or image)
- About 5 minutes

**By the end of this guide:** you'll have a project, uploaded media, seen optimization in action, and optionally created API keys and invited teammates.

## Your First RIXL Project

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Create Your Workspace**
    
    Projects keep your media, team, and settings separate. Go to **Settings → Projects → Create New Project** and fill in:
    - **Project Name**: Something you'll recognize (like "Marketing Videos" or "Product Photos")
    - **Description** (optional)

  <Step>
    **Pick Server Location**  
    Choose the region closest to your users for best delivery performance:
    - **US East**, **US West**, **Europe**  
    <Callout type="warning">
      Server location cannot be changed after creation — choose carefully.
    </Callout>

  <Step>
    **Select Default Optimization**  
    Pick a default video quality tier:
    - **Shorts** — social/mobile  
    - **Standard** — general web delivery  
    - **Pro** — VOD / high-fidelity
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Create & Continue**  
    After creation you can immediately start [uploading media](/platform/dashboard/media) and create [API keys](/platform/dashboard/api-keys) if needed.
  </Step>

  </Step>


  ## Upload Something (Quick)
    
    In your project, go to the [Media section](/platform/dashboard/media) and drag in some files.
    
    **What you can upload:**
    - **Videos**: MP4, MOV, AVI, and more (up to 2GB each)
    - **Images**: JPG, PNG, HEIC, SVG, and others (up to 100MB each)
    
    RIXL will automatically optimize everything for web delivery—you'll see the magic happen in real-time.
  
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Get Your API Keys** *(Optional for getting started)*
    
    If you plan to integrate RIXL into an app or website, you'll need [API keys](/platform/dashboard/api-keys). Each project gets its own set of keys for security.
    
    Don't worry about this step if you're just testing things out—you can always come back to it later.
    
    <Callout type="warning">
      API keys are like passwords for your project. Keep them secure and never share them publicly.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Invite Your Team** *(Optional but recommended)*
    
    Working with others? Set up an [Organization](/platform/account/organizations/team-management) and invite your team.
    
    **Available roles:**
    - **Owner**: Can do everything (including manage billing)
    - **Admin**: Can manage projects and team members
    - **Member**: Can upload and manage content
    - **Viewer**: Can view content but not make changes
  </Step>
