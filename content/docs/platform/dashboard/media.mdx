## Media Analytics

Track how your media is being processed, stored, and accessed:

<Tabs items={['Storage Analytics', 'Processing Metrics', 'Access Patterns']}>

<Tab value="Storage Analytics">
  - Video and image storage by project - Usage trends and growth patterns -
  Allocations vs. limits - Optimization recommendations
</Tab>

<Tab value="Processing Metrics">
  - Average processing times - Queue status and backlog - Success and error
  rates - Cost breakdown and optimization tips
</Tab>

<Tab value="Access Patterns">
- Most accessed media  
- Downloads and view stats  
- API usage  
- Team access patterns  
- Content performance insights  
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Security & Permissions

Media access follows your project's security model:

- Team member roles define in-dashboard permissions ([Membership Settings](/platform/account/membership))
- API keys control programmatic access ([API Access](/platform/account/api-access))
- Assets can be set as private or shared via direct URLs

<Callout type="warning">
  For critical media, always maintain backups in addition to RIXL’s secure
  storage.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

### Video

- Select optimization type based on use case
- Use descriptive names and metadata
- Monitor status and resolve errors quickly
- Review storage usage regularly

### Images

- Upload in high quality and use transformations for delivery
- Use `auto=format,compress` for best performance
- Apply consistent naming conventions

### Organization

- Group assets by project
- Archive unused files regularly
- Use workflows for approval and publishing
