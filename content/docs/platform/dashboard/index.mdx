## How to Navigate

Your dashboard has two main areas:

**[Project Workspace](/docs/platform/dashboard/projects):** Upload media, create feeds, and manage daily content workflows.  

**[Settings & Admin](/docs/platform/account/overview):** Manage account settings, team permissions, billing, and API configuration.  

**Pro Tip:** The [Media Library](/docs/platform/dashboard/media) is your central hub—upload anything, and RIXL automatically optimizes it for global delivery. No extra setup required.
