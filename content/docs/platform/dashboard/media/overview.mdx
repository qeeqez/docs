## Analytics & Security

### Media Analytics

Track how your media is being processed, stored, and accessed:

- Storage usage and growth trends
- Processing metrics and optimization tips
- Access patterns and engagement insights
- API usage tracking

### Security & Permissions

Media access follows your project’s security model:

- Team roles define dashboard permissions ([Membership Settings](/platform/account-teams/membership))
- API keys control programmatic access ([API Access](/platform/api-documentation/create-key))
- Assets can be private or shared via secure URLs

<Callout type="warning">
  For critical media, always maintain backups in addition to RIXL’s secure storage.
</Callout>
