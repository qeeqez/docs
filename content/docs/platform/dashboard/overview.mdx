## How to Navigate

Your dashboard has two main areas:

**[Project Workspace](/platform/dashboard/projects/overview):** Upload media, create feeds, and manage daily content workflows.

**[Settings & Admin](/platform/account/overview):** Manage account settings, team permissions, billing, and API configuration.

**Pro Tip:** The [Media Library](/platform/dashboard/media/overview) is your central hub—upload anything, and RIXL automatically optimizes it for global delivery. No extra setup required.
