## What are Projects on RIXL Cloud?

Projects help you organize your media, manage team access, and track usage. Youâ€™ll need to create a project before uploading any media.

<Callout type="info">
Projects serve as workspaces that contain all your content with dedicated settings and API keys. Once a project is set up, you can create API keys for it and move forward with media uploads and management.
