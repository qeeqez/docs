## Getting Started

<Callout type="info">
    You cannot upload anything without a project. Think of a project as a container for all your media and feeds, with its own settings and API keys.
</Callout>

## Project Setup Process

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Create an Account

        First, you need to sign up on Rixl using one of the following methods:
        - Email and password registration
        - Google Authentication
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Create a Project

        Once you're logged in, create your first project. The most important decision during project creation is
        selecting the **server location** for your assets.

        [//]: # (<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of project creation form showing server location selection -->)

        <Callout type="warn">
            Choose your server location carefully as this affects upload performance and latency for your users.
        </Callout>

        #### Available Server Locations

        - **Default**: Eastern Europe - Germany (AWS)
        - **Additional regions**: More locations will be made available in the future
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Configure Default Settings

        Inside your project, you can customize default preferences to match your workflow:

        [//]: # (<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of project settings dashboard showing configuration options -->)

        - **Default video quality**: Set to `shorts` (optimized for vertical/social content) by default
        - **Per-upload overrides**: Change quality settings for individual uploads
        - **Project-wide defaults**: Update default settings that apply to all future uploads
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Generate API Keys

        For external uploads and integrations, you'll need to create API keys:

        [//]: # (<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of A/PI key generation interface in project settings -->)

        1. Navigate to your project settings
        2. Generate a new API key
        3. Use this key in the `X-API-KEY` header for all API requests

        #### API Key Management

        [//]: # (<!-- TODO: Add screenshot showing API key management interface with multiple keys -->)

        <Callout type="tip">
            You can create multiple API keys with different permissions and expiration dates for
            better security management.
        </Callout>

        **Key features:**
        - Multiple keys per project
        - Configurable expiration dates
        - Easy revocation and regeneration
    </Step>
</Steps>
