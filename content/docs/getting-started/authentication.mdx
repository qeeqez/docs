To keep your projects secure, RIXL uses API keys for authentication. Each project gets its own key for accessing the RIXL API.

<Callout type="warning">
API keys are shown only once at creation. Store them securely and never share them publicly.
</Callout>

Authentication is required to access the RIXL Cloud APIs. API keys are project-specific and provide secure access to upload, manage, and deliver media within that project's scope.

## Understanding API Keys

API keys are unique identifiers that let you securely upload, manage, and deliver media for a specific project. You'll create your API key after setting up your first project.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Project-Scoped**: Each API key belongs to a specific project
- **Secure Access**: Keys provide authenticated access to the RIXL API  
- **Configurable**: Set expiration dates and permissions for enhanced security
- **Single-Use Display**: Keys are only shown once at creation for security

## Creating an API Key

<Steps>
<Step>
**Navigate to Project Settings**

Go to your project dashboard and select "API Keys" from the settings menu.
</Step>

<Step>
**Generate New Key**

Click "Create API Key" and configure any security settings like expiration dates.
</Step>

<Step>
**Save Your Key Immediately**

Copy and store the key securely - it will only be shown once.
</Step>

<Step>
**Test the Key**

Verify your key works by making a test API request.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="error">
API keys are only shown once at creation. Save your key immediately as it cannot be retrieved later.
</Callout>

## Using Your API Key

Include the API key in your requests using the `X-API-Key` header:

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.rixl.com/v1/images/upload/init" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-image.jpg",
    "format": "jpg"
  }'
```

## Security Best Practices

**API Key Management:**
- Keep API keys secure and rotate them regularly
- Never include keys in client-side code or public repositories
- Use environment variables for key storage
- Set appropriate expiration dates
- Monitor key usage for suspicious activity

**Authentication Guidelines:**
- Use keys for server-to-server authentication only
- Create limited-scope API keys when possible
- Rotate keys periodically as part of security maintenance
- Revoke compromised keys immediately

## Next Steps

Now that authentication is set up, you can start using the RIXL platform:
