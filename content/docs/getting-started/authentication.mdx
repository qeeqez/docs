## API Key Authentication

Before you can start uploading, you need to be authenticated. Rixl's API uses **API Keys (`X-API-KEY`)** for external scope operations.
This is the key you will use in your mobile apps, web apps, or server-side tools to interact with our API directly.

<Callout type="info">
    You generate API keys from within a specific project in your Rixl dashboard. You can set their permissions and expiration dates.
</Callout>

## Key Features

API keys provide secure and flexible authentication for your applications:

**Secure Integration**: Designed to be embedded in your public-facing application code to upload images, videos, and posts securely.

**Flexible Permissions**: Configure access levels for different operations within your project scope.

**Expiration Control**: Set custom expiration dates for enhanced security management.

**Project-Specific**: Each API key is tied to a specific project, ensuring proper access control.

## Usage

Use your **API Key** when your application's end-users are performing actions, like uploading content, or when your backend server needs to communicate with Rixl programmatically.

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.rixl.com/images/upload/init" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-image.jpg",
    "format": "jpg"
  }'
```

<Callout type="warn">
    Keep your API keys secure and rotate them regularly. Never expose them in client-side code where they could be accessed by unauthorized users.
</Callout>
