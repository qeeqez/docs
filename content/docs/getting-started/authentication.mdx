To keep your projects secure, RIXL uses API keys. Each project gets its own key for accessing the RIXL API.

<Callout type="info">
API keys are project-specific and provide secure access to upload, manage, and deliver media within that project's scope.
</Callout>

## Understanding API Keys

API keys are unique to each project and let you securely upload, manage, and deliver media for that project.

<Callout type="info">
You'll create your API key after setting up your first project. This page explains how authentication works in RIXL.
</Callout>

## How API Keys Work

- **Project-Scoped**: Each API key belongs to a specific project
- **Secure Access**: Keys provide authenticated access to the RIXL API
- **Configurable**: Set expiration dates and permissions for enhanced security
- **Single-Use Display**: Keys are only shown once at creation for security

## Creating an API Key

After setting up your project, you can create API keys by following these steps:

1. Navigate to your project dashboard
2. Go to **Quick Actions** or **Organization Settings â†’ API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Configure the key name and expiration
5. Copy and securely store the generated key

<Callout type="error">
API keys are only shown once at creation. Save your key immediately as it cannot be retrieved later.
</Callout>

## Using Your API Key

Include the API key in your requests using the `X-API-Key` header:

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.rixl.com/v1/images/upload/init" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-image.jpg",
    "format": "jpg"
  }'
```

## Security Best Practices

- Keep API keys secure and rotate them regularly
- Never include keys in client-side code
- Use environment variables for key storage
- Set appropriate expiration dates
- Monitor key usage for suspicious activity

## Next Steps

Now that authentication is set up, you can:
