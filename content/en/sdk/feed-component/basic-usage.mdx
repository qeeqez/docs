## Importing the Feed Component

```tsx
import { Feed } from '@rixl/videosdk-react';
```

## Essential Props

Every Feed component needs at minimum:

```tsx
<Feed
  feedId="your-feed-id" // Required: Your feed ID from dash.rixl.com
/>
```

## Simple Feed Example

Here's a basic implementation with common settings:

```tsx
import { Feed } from '@rixl/videosdk-react';

function BasicFeed() {
  return (
        <div className={`md:w-2/5 w-[90%] mx-auto h-screen`}>
            <Feed feedId={`id-from-dashboard`} />
        </div>
  );
}
```

## Common Use Cases

### Social Media Feed (Standard Implementation)

```tsx
function SocialFeed() {
  return (
    <main className="w-full h-screen bg-black">
      <Feed
        feedId="following-feed"
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

    **Mobile-First**: Design your feed layout with mobile devices in mind, as most feed interactions happen on mobile platforms.
